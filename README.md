Guild Wars 2 Addons Manager is a simple script that lets you update addons for Guild Wars 2.
Note that Guild Wars 2 has neither explicitly denied nor allowed the addons that are installed by the script. That means, they are OK'ish to use. Only OK'ish, because they can't control future updates of the addons and therefore can't give a green light.

You have two options on running this script.
Either you download each time the recent Version and execute it or you download the Gw2-AddonsManager.ps1 and run it from there. I'm working on a more convenient way to run it...

A. Download & Execute everytime.
1. Open a powershell
2. paste "(iwr https://gitlab.deep-space-nomads.com/Redicious/guild-wars-2-addons-manager/-/raw/master/Gw2-AddonsManager.ps1).content | iex" into the shell and press enter.
3. Have fun

B. Download the file and run it with powershell
