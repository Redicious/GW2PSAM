Guild Wars 2 Addons Manager is a simple script that lets you update addons for Guild Wars 2.
Note that Guild Wars 2 has neither explicitly denied nor allowed the addons that are installed by the script. That means, they are OK'ish to use. Only OK'ish, because they can't control future updates of the addons and therefore can't give a green light.

Instructions (WIP)
1. Open a PowerShell (might need evalated PowerShell)
2. Copy the Script from the gitlab site foo
3. Paste it into the PowerShell (Rightclick)
4. Identify the GW2 Folder
5. Choose the option you want to use
6. Have fun


Troubleshooting
By changing the last line to "Start-AddonsManager -Verbose", you can get more debug output, that might help to identify the issue.
