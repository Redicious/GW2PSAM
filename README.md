Guild Wars 2 Addons Manager is a simple script that lets you update addons for Guild Wars 2.
Note that Guild Wars 2 has neither explicitly denied nor allowed the addons that are installed by the script. That means, they are OK'ish to use. Only OK'ish, because they can't control future updates of the addons and therefore can't give a green light.

Instructions
1. Download the latest Version to your Guild Wars 2 Directory
2. Open your Guild Wars 2 Directory with Explorer
3. Type into the addressbar "Powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"
4. A Shell will open where you enter the following ".\Gw2-addons.ps1" and press enter.
5. Choose the option you want to use
6. Have fun


Troubleshooting
By calling the script ".\Gw-addons.ps1 -Verbose" (see Instruction Step 4), you can get more debug output, that might help to identify the issue.
